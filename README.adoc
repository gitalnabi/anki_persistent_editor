= Anki Persistent Editor

This is an add-on that makes the editor window during Review persistent.

There are two important shortcuts:
- `e` will trigger the editor window.
  This is identical to the standard Anki behavior.
  Clicking `e` again will bring focus to the editor window. 

- `c` will flip the card, going to the front, if you're on the back and vice versa.
  Before creating this add-on, I typically used the editor shortcut to go back to the front of the card.
  This is no longer possible, the editor shortcut won't change which side of the card is displayed.
  For this reason, you can this shortcut to have the old functionality.
